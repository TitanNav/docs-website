metaDescription: "Here's how to use Slack to notify your teammates about changes you are capturing with change tracking."
---

You can use Slack to notify your teams about activities you're following with the change tracking feature. For example, after you record a deployment using the change tracking NerdGraph API (or the older deployment REST v2 API), you could notify your teams using a webhook endpoint for the deployment.

The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel:

1. Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to **App directory > Manage > Apps**.
2. Search for your New Relic app, then select **Add configuration**.
3. From **Post to channel**, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then select **Add configuration**.
4. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL.
5. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > (user menu) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook**.
6. Paste the Slack webhook URL and then save your changes.
7. (Optional) Send a test message.

If you have questions about how to capture changes so you'll be able to set up a Slack notification, see [Start tracking your changes](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction#start-tracking).
