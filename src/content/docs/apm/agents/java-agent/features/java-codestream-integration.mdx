metaDescription: The Java agent can be integrated with New Relic CodeStream to provide code-level metrics.
---

Display context-sensitive APM data directly in your IDE by integrating [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoring#code-level) with the Java agent. Visualize code-level production telemetry in your editor as your write and review code with this integration.

## Getting started

First, [install](/docs/codestream/start-here/install-codestream) the New Relic CodeStream extension into your supported IDE of choice and log in.

<Callout variant="important">
  The New Relic CodeStream integration is available in the Java agent since version 7.10.0. It is enabled by default on agent version 7.11.0 and higher. See [Java agent configuration: Config file](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#code-level-metrics) for instructions on how to enabled or disable it.
</Callout>

## Agent attributes

The Java agent reports and attaches the following attributes to spans produced by your application:

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
      **Name**
    </th>

    <th>
      **Description**
    </th>

    <th>
      **Example**
    </th>
  </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>
      `code.function`
    </td>

    <td>
      The name of the instrumented function (Java method).
    </td>

    <td>
      retrieveData
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      `code.namespace`
    </td>

    <td>
      The namespace (fully qualified class name) in which `code.function` is defined
    </td>

    <td>
      com.example.MyService
    </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout variant="important">
  Spans created using the API method `NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment()` will not contain these attributes. To create a span that contain these attributes annotate a method with `@Trace` or use XML instrumentation.
