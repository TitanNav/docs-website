metaDescription: The Node.js agent can be integrated with New Relic CodeStream to provide code level metrics.
---

Display context-sensitive APM data directly in your IDE by integrating [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoring#code-level) with the Node.js agent. This integration visualizes code-level production telemetry in your editor as your write and review code.

## Get started [#get-started]

First, [install](/docs/codestream/start-here/install-codestream) the New Relic CodeStream extension into your supported IDE of choice, and log in.

<Callout variant="important">
  The New Relic CodeStream integration is available in [Node.js agent version 9.7.5 and higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes) and is disabled by default. To change this configuration, check out our [documentation](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#code-level-metrics).
</Callout>

## Agent attributes [#attributes]

The Node.js agent reports and attaches the following attributes to most spans produced by [web frameworks](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent#support) in your application.

<Callout variant="important">
  In some cases, the agent will directly wrap base framework code that's invoked within your application and won't display within your IDE.
